## Database Population ##

We found that hitting the BreweryDB API in the ways we needed on each page load were taking an unacceptably long amount of time. We will leverage `scripts/populate-db.exs` in a cron job to periodically pull down the brewery and beer data that we need, updating our local database so we can serve these pages faster. 


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
